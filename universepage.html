      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <p>The universe is the sum total of all the planetary systems, stars, nebulae, galaxies, galactic clusters, black holes, and the atoms and molecules that make all these objects. It also contains all the energy we know about, along with dark matter, which has not been directly observed.</p>

      <h2>Quick Facts</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>The initial ‘state’ of the universe was called the Planck epoch. It lasted a tiny fraction of a second, and at that point all matter of all kinds was condensed into a tiny point.</li>
        <li>The period of “inflation” began at the end of the Planck epoch, and the synthesis of the original elements took place over a period of about 20 minutes. For the next 380,000 years, as the infant universe expanded and cooled, everything was a hot, dense plasma and liight could not pass through it.</li>
        <li>The initial “glow” of the Big Bang can be seen throughout space today as the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMB).</li>
        <li>It is not clear what the ultimate fate of the universe is. Currently some cosmologists consider that the universe will continue to expand, ultimately cooling off, or “freezing out”. That would result in the heat death of the cosmos.</li>
        <li>The expansion rate of the universe has sped up in “modern” cosmic time.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Fun Fact</h2>
      <p>The universe is observed to be 13.7 billion years old and has been expanding since its birth in the Big Bang. Due to this expansion, the universe is now thought to be be around 91 billion light-years across.</p>
